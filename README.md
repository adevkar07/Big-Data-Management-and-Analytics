# Map Reduce 

Above codes are based on Map Reduce Techniques. 
I have used two datasets which represent friend list and personal information of them. I have tried to co-relate these two data sets using map reduce technique to find some interesting information from the two!  

MutualFriends.java - 
This code finds out the mutual friends between any two users.

Top10MutualFriends.java -
This code helps to find the list of top 10 friends who have maximum number of mutual friends.

StatesOfMutualFriends.java - 
Given any two Users (they are friend) as input, output the list of the names and the state of their mutual friends using in-memory join.

MaximumAvg.java -
Calculate and display the top 15 people who have average age of their direct friends.
